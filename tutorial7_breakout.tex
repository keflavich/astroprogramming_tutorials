\section{Tutorial: How to break out of commands}

What do you do if you've entered the wrong thing, and you haven't gotten your
command line back?  This applies to both IDL and the unix (bash) command line.

Say you enter the command \\
\verb|echo "I like to type| \\
and press enter.  You're
now left with a prompt that looks like \verb|>| instead of your friendly
\verb|cosmos ~$|.  Bash (the unix command line) thinks you want to enter more
text.  So, you could type  \\
\verb|multiple lines"| \\
and press enter, and it should
print out the text for you.  

An alternative is to press and hold the ``Control'' key and press ``C''.  This
``breaks'' the currently running command.

Let's try this in IDL.  Try running this command, then quicky pressing Control-c:
\verb|print,findgen(1000000)|
It should stop printing long before it gets to 999999.

You will probably want to use this key combination a lot.  

\section{Part 2: When stuff is really broken}

NOTE: The following procedure is generally a bad idea.  

The following command will wreck your IDL session:

\verb|while(1) do print,"Stop!"|

It will print the word ``Stop!'' indefinitely.  If you hit Control-c, it will not
stop: it's an awful runaway process.  Awful.  

Press Control-z!  It will ``stop'' IDL, sending it to the background.
The process isn't really dead yet, we need to \verb|kill| it.

Enter the command \verb|jobs| to show that IDL is still there, hiding.
Enter the command \verb|ps| and look for the CMD idl.  There should be a PID column - 
note the number associated with IDL.

Now we kill it [replace PID with the PID #]:

\verb|kill PID| 


Type  \verb|ps| again to see if it's still there.  It might be, which is annoying.

Type \verb|fg| to bring IDL back to the \verb|f|ore\verb|g|round.  It should be
dead for real now.

\section{Part 3: Quitting things}
Start up IDL.

Press Control-d.

This should quit your IDL session!  It is a shortcut for that.  Be careful, Control-d also
quits your ``terminal'' session if you press it at the \verb|$| prompt.
