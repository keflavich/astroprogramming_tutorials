\section{Group Project: A Game?!}

Consider the following problem:

You and an opponent are competing for a prize of M \& Ms.  The game is simple:
If you and the opponent agree to share, you each get 2 M \& Ms.  However, if
you say you want all of them, and your opponent says they want to share, you
get 3 M \& Ms and they \emph{lose} one.  If BOTH of you say you want all of the
M \& Ms, neither of you get any.

Of course, you must state your decision (share or be greedy) at the exact same
time.

And also, of course, YOU don't get to play - you have to write a program to
play in your place.

We will make groups of 3 students each, and you will work collaboratively to
write the best possible gaming program you can.  Your goal is to \emph{win}
AND to get the most M \& Ms possible.

The team with the most \emph{wins} will get a small bonus - enough to fatten
your pocket, but not enough that \emph{just} winning is worthwhile (you also
need to maximize your ``points'').
